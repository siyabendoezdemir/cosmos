# cosmos
Cosmos is an AI that helps people feel safer at home using Pose Estimation. Using Tensorflow modules it checks for falling people and asks if they need help. It is still under development but more features like emergency messages are planned already. The goal of cosmos is to implement it into a retirement home to help with the privacy of the elderly by using AI instead of a nurse watching over someone 24/7

The whole thing is written in React.JS and is supposed to be a lightweight program that can run on any laptop straight from the browser. 

I'm also considering moving the logic to a server written in Python and handling the video input and the admin output to a user Interface written in React.js.
