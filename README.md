# Getting started with Cosmos

### About Cosmos
Cosmos is a multifunctional AI made to make people feel safer at home alone. Using the newest technology Cosmos can detect things and help people in cases of emergencies. This way we can keep people safe even if nobody's around. Cosmos was made with the purpose of helping people focus on other things than safety and save lives if it can. It will do anything it can to achieve this goal and help, not only elderly people, but also younger people be safe while home alone.

Cosmos was created by me, I'm Siyabend Oezdemir. You can check out my profile to find out more about me or you can message me on LinkedIn. My intention behind Cosmos was to play around with AI until one of my co-workers told me that I could make something useful out of this. So I decided that this would be the best use case since I know a lot of people that aren't able to visit their grandparents/parents very often and since retirement homes often have problems with privacy for the elderly I thought that this could be a solution to this problem.

### How does it work?
Cosmos uses a variety of libraries to ensure that it's only using the best data on the market. Accuracy and reliability is the key to making Cosmos more helpful so it needs good data to be able to process what is happening at the moment. 

To achieve this Cosmos uses data from Google and other big companies that have trained their own models like MoveNet by Google for Pose Estimation. Cosmos also uses popular libraries for it's speech recognition and for it's own voice to ensure that no command is misunderstood. 


## How to run Cosmos
